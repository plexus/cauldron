# Cauldron

This is my personal creative playground for [Witchcraft](https://github.com/lambdaisland/witchcraft), the Clojure library for interactive Minecraft coding. It contains numerous helper functions, code to generate structures or shape landscape, and interactive sessions of specific projects (under `repl_sessions`).

You are welcome to steal from here, or just use it as inspiration. I'm putting it out here so people have a place where they can find a bunch of example code of what you can do with Witchcraft.

Big shoutout to [Glowstone](https://glowstone.net/) which makes all this fun stuff possible.
